                <p>
                    On April 25, 2003, Aron Ralston he traveled to southeastern Utah to explore
                    Canyonlands National Park. He slept in his truck that night, and at 9:15 the next morning,
                    -- a beautiful, sunny Saturday -- he rode his bicycle 15 miles to Bluejohn
                    Canyon, an 11-mile-long gorge that in some places is just 3 feet wide. He locked his bike
                    and walked torwards the canyons opening.

                <p>
                    Ralston hadn’t told anyone about his climbing plan, and he didn’t have any signal
                    for help. He inventoried his provisions: two burritos, some candy bar crumbs, and a
                    bottle of water.<br><br>
                    He futilely tried chipping away at the boulder. Eventually, he ran out of water and
                    had to drink his own urine.
                    Distraught and delirious, Aron Ralston resigned himself to his fate.
                    <br><br>He used his dull tools to carve his name into the canyon wall, along with his birthdate, the day’s
                    date -- his presumed date of death -- and the letters RIP. Then, he used a video
                    camera to tape goddbyes to his family and attemted to sleep. </p>

                <p>
                    That night, as he drifted in and out of conscoiusness, Ralston dreamt of himself,
                    with only half his right arm, playing with a child.
                    <br><br>
                    Awaking, he believed the dream was a sign that he would survive and that he would
                    have a family. With a determined sense of resolution, he threw himself into
                    survival.
                    <br><br>
                    The dream of a future family and life outside the canyon left Aron Ralston with an
                    epiphany: he didn’t have to cut through his bones. <br><br>
                    He could break them instead.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Using the torque from his trapped arm, he managed to break his ulna and his
                    radius.<br><br>

                    After his bones were disconnected, he fashioned a tourniquet from the tubing of his
                    Camelbak water bottle and cut off his circulation entirely.<br><br>

                    Then, he was able to use a cheap, dull, two-inch knife to cut through his tendons.
                    He left his arteries for last, knowing that after he servered them he wouldn’t
                    have much time.
                    <br><br>
                    The entire process took an hour, during which Ralston lost 25 percent of his blood
                    volume.

                    High on adrenaline and the sheer will to live, Ralston climbed out of the slot canyon,
                    rappelled down a 65-foot sheer cliff, and hiked 6 of the 8 miles back to his car -- all
                    while severely dehydrated, continuously losing blood, and one-handed.
