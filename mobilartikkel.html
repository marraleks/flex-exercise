        <p>That night, as he drifted in and
            out of consciousness, Ralston dreamt of himself, with only half his
            right arm, playing with a child. Awaking, he believed the dream was a sign that he would survive and
            that he would have a family. With a determined sense of resolution, he threw himself into survival.
            <br><br>
            The dream of a future family and life outside the canyon left Aron Ralston with an epiphany: he didnâ€™t
            have to cut through his bones. He could break them instead.
