                                Canyonlands<br>
                                National Park. He slept in his truck that night, <br>and at 9:15 the next morning
                                -- a beautiful,<br> sunny Saturday -- he rode his bicycle 15 miles<br> to Bluejohn
                                Canyon, an
                                11-mile-long gorge that <br>in some places is just 3 feet wide. He locked <br>his bike
                                and
                                walked torwards the canyons opening.

                                Ralston hadn’t told anyone about his climbing plan, <br> and he didn’t have any signal

                                help. He inventoried his provisions: two burritos, some candy bar crumbs, and<br> a
                                bottle
                                of water.<br><br><br><br>
                                He futilely tried chipping away at the boulder. Eventually, <br>he ran out of water and

                                to drink his own urine.

                                tools to carme his name into<br> the canyon wall, along with his birthdate, the day’s

                                <br>-- his presumed date of death -- and the letters RIP. Then, <br>he used a video

                                That night, as he drifted in and out of conscoiusness,<br> Ralston dreamt of himself,
                                with only half his right arm,<br>playing with a child.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Awaking, he believed the dream was a sign that he would<br> survive and that he would
                                have a family. With a determined <br>sense of resolution, he threw himself into
                                survival.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                The dream of a future family and life outside the canyon<br> left Aron Ralston with an
                                epiphany: he didn’t have to cut<br> through his bones. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                                He could break them instead.

                                Using the torque from his trapped arm, he managed<br> to break his ulna and his radius.<br><br><br><br>

                                After his bones were disconnected, he fashioned a <br>tourniquet from the tubing of his
                                Camelbak water<br> bottle and cut off his circulation entirely.<br><br><br><br>

                                Then, he was able to use a cheap,<br> dull, two-inch knife to cut through his tendons.
                                He left<br>his arteries for last, knowing that after he servered them<br> he wouldn’t
                                have much time.

                                The entire process took an hour, during which Ralston <br>lost 25 percent of his blood
