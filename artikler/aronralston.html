            <h1>The man who<br>amputated his own arm</h1>
            <p>On April 25, 2003, Aron Ralston he traveled to southeastern Utah to explore Canyonlands National Park. He
                slept in his truck that night, and at 9:15 the next morning — a beautiful, sunny Saturday — he rode his
                bicycle 15 miles to Bluejohn Canyon, an 11-mile-long gorge that in some places is just 3 feet wide. He
                locked his bike and walked toward the canyon’s opening.</p>

        right hand became lodged between the canyon wall and the 800-pound boulder, leaving him trapped 100 feet
        below the desert surface and 20 miles from the nearest paved road.

        <p>Ralston hadn’t told anyone about his climbing plans, and he didn’t have any way to signal for help. He inventoried his provisions: two burritos, some candy bar crumbs, and a bottle of water.</p> <br>
           <p>He futilely tried chipping away at the boulder. Eventually, he ran out of water and had to drink his own urine.</p>

                <p>Distraught and delirious, Aron Ralston resigned himself to his fate. He used his dull tools to carve his name into the canyon wall, along with his birthdate, the day’s date — his presumed date of death — and the letters RIP. Then, he used a video camera to tape goodbyes to his family and attempted to sleep.</p>

            <p>That night, as he drifted in and out of consciousness, Ralston dreamt of himself, with only half his
                right arm, playing with a child. Awaking, he believed the dream was a sign that he would survive and
                that he would have a family. With a determined sense of resolution, he threw himself into survival.
                <br><br>
                The dream of a future family and life outside the canyon left Aron Ralston with an epiphany: he didn’t
                have to cut through his bones. He could break them instead.

            <div class="wrap">
                <p>Using the torque from his trapped arm, he managed to break his ulna and his radius. After his bones
                    were disconnected, he fashioned a tourniquet from the tubing of his Camelbak water bottle and cut
                    off his circulation entirely. Then, he was able to use a cheap, dull, two-inch knife to cut through
                    his skin and muscle, and a pair of pliers to cut through his tendons. He left his arteries for last,
                    knowing that after he severed them he wouldn’t have much time.</p>
                <p>He left his arteries for last, knowing that after he severed them he wouldn’t have much time. The
                    entire process took an hour, during which Ralston lost 25 percent of his blood volume. High on
                    adrenaline and the sheer will to live, Ralston climbed out of the slot canyon, rappelled down a
                    65-foot sheer cliff, and hiked 6 of the 8 miles back to his car — all while severely dehydrated,
                    continuously losing blood, and one-handed.</p>
